//Take-Home Practice (2 Questions)
//Question 1: Ternary Operator
//Context: "The inventory management team at Contoso Corporation is focusing on the
//'Cell phones' category to ensure that stores maintain adequate stock levels.
//They need to identify which stores are at risk of running out of inventory and
//may require a reorder. The team wants a report that lists each store, the specific
//cell phone products they carry, and whether a reorder is necessary. The reorder is
//required if the sum of the current on-hand quantity and on-order quantity is less
//than the safety stock quantity. This report should be organized by store ID to help
//the team prioritize which locations need immediate attention."
//Question: "How would you filter the Inventories table to retrieve records for
//products in the 'Cell phones' category, and return the results as an anonymous
//data set that includes the store ID, store name, product name, and whether a
//reorder is necessary, ordered by store ID, then by ProductName?"
Inventories
	.Where(x => x.Product.ProductSubcategory.ProductCategory.ProductCategoryName == "Cell phones")
	.Select(x => new {
		StoreID = x.StoreID,
		StoreName = x.Store.StoreName,
		ProductName = x.Product.ProductName,
		Reorder = x.SafetyStockQuantity > x.OnHandQuantity + x.OnOrderQuantity ?
					"Yes" : "No"
	})
	.OrderBy(x => x.StoreID)
	.ThenBy(x => x.ProductName)
	.Dump();

//Question 2: Ternary Operator
//Context: "The finance department at Contoso Corporation is conducting an analysis
//of customer invoices to prioritize collection efforts. They are particularly
//interested in identifying high-value invoices—those with amounts exceeding $5,000
//—as these should be flagged as 'High Priority' for immediate follow-up.
//The department wants a report that lists all invoices, sorted alphabetically by the
//customer's last name, to ensure easy navigation. The report should include the
//invoice number, date, customer name, store name, the manager's location
//(represented by the city), and whether the invoice is considered high or low priority
//based on the total amount."
//Question: "How would you filter the Invoices table to retrieve all invoices, and
//return the results as an anonymous data set that includes the invoice number, date,
//customer name, store name, manager's city, and priority status, ordered by the
//customer's last name?"
Invoices
	.OrderBy(x => x.Customer.LastName)
	.Select(x => new {
		InvoiceNo = x.InvoiceID,
		//InvoiceDate = x.DateKey.ToShortDateString(),
		InvoiceDate = x.DateKey.ToString("M'/'d'/'yyyy"),
		Name = $"{x.Customer.FirstName} {x.Customer.LastName}",
		StoreName = x.Store.StoreName,
		Manager = x.Store.Geography.CityName,
		Priority = x.TotalAmount > 5000 ? "High Priority" : "Low Priority"
	})
	.Dump();
